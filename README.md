# World Cup Games Database Project

Welcome to my World Cup Games Database project! This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in both BASH scripting and PostgreSQL database management by creating a script that populates a PostgreSQL database with World Cup games information and performs various queries to extract useful statistics.

## Description

This project focuses on creating a Bash script that interacts with a PostgreSQL database to manage World Cup games data. The script performs tasks such as importing game information from CSV files into the database, running queries to retrieve specific statistics, and showcasing the power of combining BASH scripting and relational database management.

## Abilities and Concepts Demonstrated

- Database Creation: Set up a new PostgreSQL database to store data.
- Data Insertion: Insert data into the database tables using SQL INSERT statements.
- Relationships: Establish relationships between tables using foreing keys.
- Constraints and Validation: Implement various constraints like UNIQUE and NOT NULL for data validation and integrity.
- Querying: Craft required queries to retrieve relevant information from the database.
- BASH scripting: Develop a BASH script to interact with the database when executed.

## Achievement

This project allowed me to gain insights into PostgreSQL and practice basic SQL queries and operations and at the same time reinforce my algorithmic and problem solving skill by using BASH to interact with the database.
